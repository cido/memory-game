#Workshop steps

* Implement fetchNewCards()
    * ...fetch URLs, console.log() the result
    * ...create 2*15 cards, console.log() the result
    * ...set the cards to state.cards

* Draw the cards to the GameBoard

* Implement flipping of a card on a click (SASS styles are premade)
    * It would be handy to be able to select only two cards
    * It would be handy to be able to de-select a selected card

* Implement founding of matching pairs (.found class is premade)
    * And then check that one can not click a found card again
